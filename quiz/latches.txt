How does a latch differ from a flip-flop?
 Latches are edge-triggered, while flip-flops are level-sensitive.
 Latches can only store one bit of information, while flip-flops can store multiple bits.
 Latches change their output whenever the input changes and the clock signal meets certain conditions, while flip-flops only change on a clock edge.
 Latches are only used for temporary storage, while flip-flops are used for long-term storage.

What happens to the output of an SR latch when both the set (S) and reset (R) inputs are low?
 The output is set to high
 The output is reset to low
 The output holds its previous state
 The output toggles between high and low

How does a D latch differ from an SR latch?
 A D latch has two inputs, while an SR latch has three inputs.
 A D latch has a clock input, while an SR latch does not.
 A D latch can only store one bit, while an SR latch can store multiple bits.
 A D latch transfers the input value to the output on a clock edge, while an SR latch can change

What is the main advantage of using latches in asynchronous circuits?
 They are faster than flip-flops
 They are more flexible in terms of timing requirements
 They can store more bits of information
 They consume less power than flip-flops

 What is the primary difference between a latch and a flip-flop?
Latches are edge-triggered, while flip-flops are level-sensitive.
Latches are level-sensitive, while flip-flops are edge-triggered.
Latches have two stable states, while flip-flops have only one.
Latches have a clock input, while flip-flops do not.

In an SR latch, what is the state when both S and R inputs are low?
Q is high, Q' is low

What is the function of the D latch?
It toggles its output on each clock edge
It stores data and transfers it to the output on a clock edge
It holds its output until the clock changes
It converts serial data to parallel data
