    <h1>Encoder/Decoder</h1>
    <h2>Encoder</h2>
    <p>
      An encoder is a digital circuit that converts a set of input signals into
      a coded output representation. It is commonly used in digital
      communication systems, data transmission, and control systems to convert
      various types of data into a more compact format for efficient
      transmission or processing. Encoders are also used in digital-to-analog
      conversion, error detection, and data compression. There are several types
      of encoders, each designed for specific applications:
    </p>
    <h3>Priority Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      A priority encoder is used to encode multiple input signals into a binary
      code based on the priority of the input signals. It ensures that only the
      highest-priority active input is encoded, ignoring lower-priority inputs.
      Priority encoders are commonly used in interrupt handling in
      microprocessors and in data communication systems where certain signals
      need to be processed first.
    </p>
    <h3>Decimal to BCD Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      This type of encoder converts decimal (base-10) numbers into binary-coded
      decimal (BCD) format. It is often used in digital display systems and
      digital clocks where decimal digits are displayed using binary-coded
      representation.
    </p>
    <h3>Rotary Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      A rotary encoder is a type of sensor that converts the angular position or
      rotation of a shaft into an analog or digital signal. It is commonly used
      in robotics, industrial controls, and consumer electronics for measuring
      rotation or angular displacement.
    </p>
    <h3>Absolute Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      An absolute encoder provides a unique digital code for each position of a
      rotating shaft. It can determine the exact position of the shaft without
      needing a reference point. Absolute encoders are used in applications
      where precise positioning is critical, such as in industrial automation
      and robotics.
    </p>
    <h3>Gray Code Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      Gray code is a binary numeral system where two consecutive values differ
      in only one bit. A Gray code encoder converts binary numbers into Gray
      code. Gray code is used in mechanical encoders and in applications where
      reducing errors in data transmission is important.
    </p>
    <h3>Magnetic Encoder</h3>
    <p>
      A magnetic encoder uses magnetic fields to determine the position of a
      shaft or object. It is used in automotive applications, such as in
      electronic throttle control systems and anti-lock braking systems (ABS),
      as well as in robotics and industrial automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encoders play a crucial role in modern digital systems by enabling the
      conversion of various types of data into a format that is suitable for
      processing, transmission, or control. Their ability to efficiently encode
      data helps improve the performance and reliability of digital systems in a
      wide range of applications.
    </p>
    <h2>Decoder</h2>
    <p>
      A decoder is a digital circuit that performs the opposite function of an
      encoder. It takes a coded input and decodes it into a set of output
      signals. Decoders are essential components in digital systems for tasks
      such as address decoding in memory systems, selecting specific inputs in
      multiplexers, and converting coded data into a format that can be easily
      understood by other parts of the system. There are several types of
      decoders, each designed for specific applications:
    </p>
    <h3>Binary Decoder</h3>
    <p>
      A binary decoder is the most basic type of decoder, which converts a
      binary-coded input into one of multiple output lines. The number of output
      lines corresponds to the number of possible input combinations. For
      example, a 2-to-4 binary decoder has two input lines and four output
      lines, with each output line representing one of the possible binary
      combinations of the input lines.
    </p>
    <h3>Decimal Decoder</h3>
    <p>
      A decimal decoder converts a binary-coded decimal (BCD) input into one of
      ten output lines, each representing a decimal digit (0-9). Decimal
      decoders are used in digital display systems and digital clocks to convert
      BCD numbers into a format suitable for driving a display.
    </p>
    <h3>7-Segment Decoder</h3>
    <p>
      A 7-segment decoder is a specialized decoder used for driving 7-segment
      LED displays. It converts a 4-bit binary-coded input into signals that can
      illuminate the segments of a 7-segment display to represent decimal digits
      (0-9) and some alphabetic characters (A-F).
    </p>
    <h3>BCD to Excess-3 Decoder</h3>
    <p>
      This type of decoder converts BCD input into Excess-3 code, which is a
      binary code in which each digit is represented by adding 3 to the
      corresponding BCD digit. BCD to Excess-3 decoders are used in digital
      systems that require arithmetic operations using BCD numbers.
    </p>
    <h3>Gray Code Decoder</h3>
    <p>
      A Gray code decoder converts Gray code input into binary output. Gray code
      is a binary numeral system in which two consecutive values differ in only
      one bit. Gray code decoders are used in applications where error detection
      and correction are important, such as in communication systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decoders are essential components in digital systems for converting coded
      data into a format that can be easily processed, displayed, or
      transmitted. Their ability to decode data helps improve the efficiency and
      reliability of digital systems in various applications.
