    <h1>Clock</h1>
    <p>
      A clock in a digital logic simulator is a crucial component that regulates
      the timing of operations within the simulated digital circuit. It mimics
      the function of a real-world clock, providing a rhythmic signal that
      determines when the circuit should transition between different states.
    </p>

    <p>
      In digital logic, circuits operate based on discrete signals that
      represent binary values (0 or 1). These signals change their state in
      response to certain events, such as the rising or falling edge of a clock
      signal. The clock signal itself is typically a square wave that oscillates
      between two voltage levels (e.g., 0V and 5V).
    </p>

    <p>
      The clock signal is used to synchronize the behavior of different parts of
      the digital circuit. When the clock signal transitions from one state to
      another (e.g., from 0 to 1), it indicates the beginning of a new clock
      cycle. During each clock cycle, the circuit performs its operations, and
      the outputs are updated based on the inputs and the current state of the
      circuit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frequency of the clock signal determines the speed at which the
      circuit operates. A higher frequency allows the circuit to perform
      operations more quickly, but it also requires more power and can introduce
      issues such as signal skew and timing violations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a digital logic simulator, the clock is often represented by a clock
      component that can be configured with a specific frequency. The simulator
      then uses this clock signal to drive the simulation, advancing the circuit
      through each clock cycle and updating the state of the circuit
      accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      When designing digital circuits, it's important to consider the timing
      requirements imposed by the clock signal. For example, certain operations
      may need to be completed within a certain number of clock cycles to ensure
      proper functioning of the circuit. Failure to meet these timing
      requirements can result in errors or unexpected behavior.
