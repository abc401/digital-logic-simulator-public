    <h1>FlipFlop</h1>
    <p>
      A flip-flop is a fundamental building block in digital logic that is used
      to store binary information. It is a type of sequential logic circuit,
      meaning its output depends not only on its current input but also on its
      previous state.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a digital logic simulator, a flip-flop is typically represented as a
      component with inputs and outputs. The most common types of flip-flops are
      the D flip-flop, the JK flip-flop, the T flip-flop, and the SR flip-flop.
    </p>

    <h2>D flipflop</h2>
    <p>
      The D flip-flop, or data flip-flop, has a single data input (D), a clock
      input (CLK), and two outputs: Q and Q' (the inverse of Q). When the clock
      signal transitions from low to high (rising edge), the value of D is
      transferred to the output Q. This means that the flip-flop stores the
      value of D and holds it until the next rising edge of the clock signal.
    </p>
    <h2>JK flipflop</h2>
    <p>
      The JK flip-flop is similar to the D flip-flop but has two additional
      inputs: J (set) and K (reset). When both J and K are high, the flip-flop
      toggles its output on each clock cycle. When J is high and K is low, the
      flip-flop sets its output to high (Q = 1). When J is low and K is high,
      the flip-flop resets its output to low (Q = 0). And when both J and K are
      low, the flip-flop holds its current state.
    </p>
    <h2>T flip-flop</h2>
    <p>
      The T flip-flop, or toggle flip-flop, toggles its output on each clock
      cycle when its input (T) is high. It is useful for creating frequency
      dividers and counters.
    </p>
    <h2>SR flipflop</h2>
    <p>
      The SR flipflop, or set-reset flip-flop, has two inputs: S (set) and R
      (reset). When S is high and R is low, the flip-flop sets its output to
      high (Q = 1). When R is high and S is low, the flip-flop resets its output
      to low (Q = 0). When both S and R are low, the flip-flop holds its current
      state. This flip-flop is useful for creating memory elements and
      sequential circuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a digital logic simulator, flip-flops are used to store intermediate
      results, create memory elements, and implement sequential logic circuits
      such as counters, shift registers, and finite state machines.
      Understanding how flip-flops work and how to use them is essential for
      designing complex digital circuits in a simulator.
