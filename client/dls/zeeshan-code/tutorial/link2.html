    <h2>MUX</h2>
    <p>
      A multiplexer, often abbreviated as "MUX," is a fundamental building block
      in digital electronics and computer systems. It is used to select one of
      many input signals and route it to a single output. This selection process
      is controlled by a set of input selection lines, also known as control
      lines. The number of input selection lines determines the number of input
      channels the multiplexer can handle. The basic concept of a multiplexer
      can be understood by considering a simple 2-to-1 multiplexer, which has
      two input channels (A and B), one output (Y), and one control line (S).
      The truth table for a 2-to-1 multiplexer is as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>S</th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>O</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this truth table, when the select line (S) is 0, the output (Y)
      corresponds to input A, and when the select line (S) is 1, the output (Y)
      corresponds to input B. Multiplexers find applications in various areas of
      digital design, such as data routing, signal selection, and digital
      communication systems. They are often used in combination with
      demultiplexers, which perform the reverse operation, taking a single input
      and routing it to one of several outputs. Multiplexers are also used in
      the design of arithmetic logic units (ALUs), which are essential
      components in processors for performing arithmetic and logic operations.
      In ALUs, multiplexers are used to select between different operations or
      input sources based on control signals. In summary, a multiplexer is a
      versatile digital logic component that plays a crucial role in data
      processing and routing within digital systems. Its ability to select and
      route signals based on control inputs makes it a fundamental building
      block in the design of complex digital circuits.

    <h2>DeMux</h2>
    <p>
      A demultiplexer (demux) is a combinational logic circuit that takes a
      single input and selects one of many outputs based on the control inputs.
      It is essentially the opposite of a multiplexer, which selects one of many
      inputs to be routed to a single output. Demultiplexers are commonly used
      in digital electronics for data routing and distribution The truth table
      for a 2-to-1 multiplexer is as follows:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>S</th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>O</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this truth table, when the select line (S) is 0, the input (I) is
      routed to output A, and when the select line (S) is 1, the input (I) is
      routed to output B.Demultiplexers are used in various applications, such
      as in digital communication systems, where they are used to route a single
      input signal to multiple output channels based on control signals. They
      are also used in memory systems, where they can be used to select specific
      memory locations for reading or writing data. In summary, a demultiplexer
      is a digital logic component that takes a single input and routes it to
      one of several outputs based on control signals. It is the counterpart to
      a multiplexer and is essential in digital systems for signal distribution
      and routing.
