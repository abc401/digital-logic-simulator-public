    <h1>Basic Gates</h1>
    <h2>And Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The AND gate is one of the fundamental building blocks of digital
      electronic circuits. It is a digital logic gate that performs the AND
      operation, which is a basic operation in Boolean algebra. The AND gate
      takes two binary inputs (usually labeled A and B) and produces a single
      binary output (usually labeled Y), according to the following truth table:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>Y</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is 1 (or true) only when both inputs A
      and B are 1 (or true); otherwise, the output is 0 (or false). The inputs A
      and B are connected to the left side of the gate, and the output Y is on
      the right side. The AND gate can have more than two inputs, in which case
      it behaves as if all inputs must be 1 for the output to be 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key properties of the AND gate is that it can be used to
      implement logical conjunction, which is a fundamental operation in Boolean
      algebra. Conjunction is a binary operation that takes two propositions and
      produces a new proposition that is true only when both input propositions
      are true. This property makes the AND gate essential in the design of
      digital circuits that require logical AND operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The AND gate is used in various digital circuits and systems for a wide
      range of applications. One common application is in arithmetic circuits,
      where AND gates are used to perform the bitwise AND operation between
      binary numbers. In this application, each pair of corresponding bits in
      the two input numbers is fed into an AND gate, and the outputs are then
      combined to produce the final result. Another common application of the
      AND gate is in the implementation of logic functions and Boolean
      expressions. By combining multiple AND gates with other logic gates such
      as OR gates and NOT gates, complex logic functions can be implemented.
      This allows digital designers to create circuits that perform a wide range
      of logical operations, making the AND gate a versatile building block in
      digital circuit design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the AND gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the AND operation. It takes two binary
      inputs and produces a single binary output, according to the truth table.
      The AND gate is essential in digital circuit design, as it is used in
      various applications, including arithmetic circuits and logic function
      implementation. Its simple yet powerful operation makes it a key component
      in modern digital electronics.
    </p>
    <h2>Or Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The OR gate is another fundamental building block of digital electronic
      circuits. Like the AND gate, the OR gate is a digital logic gate that
      performs a basic operation in Boolean algebra. The OR gate takes two
      binary inputs (usually labeled A and B) and produces a single binary
      output (usually labeled Y), according to the following truth table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is 1 (or true) if at least one of the
      inputs A or B is 1 (or true); otherwise, the output is 0 (or false). This
      behavior can be summarized by the Boolean expression Y = A OR B. The
      inputs A and B are connected to the left side of the gate, and the output
      Y is on the right side. Like the AND gate, the OR gate can have more than
      two inputs, in which case it behaves as if at least one of the inputs must
      be 1 for the output to be 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key properties of the OR gate is that it can be used to
      implement logical disjunction, which is another fundamental operation in
      Boolean algebra. Disjunction is a binary operation that takes two
      propositions and produces a new proposition that is true if at least one
      of the input propositions is true. This property makes the OR gate
      essential in the design of digital circuits that require logical OR
      operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The OR gate is used in various digital circuits and systems for a wide
      range of applications. One common application is in the implementation of
      logic functions and Boolean expressions. By combining multiple OR gates
      with other logic gates such as AND gates and NOT gates, complex logic
      functions can be implemented. This allows digital designers to create
      circuits that perform a wide range of logical operations, making the OR
      gate a versatile building block in digital circuit design. Another common
      application of the OR gate is in the implementation of multiplexers and
      other data routing circuits. In these applications, OR gates are used to
      select between multiple data inputs based on a control signal. The OR gate
      is also used in the design of adders and other arithmetic circuits, where
      it is used to combine the carry-out signals from multiple stages of the
      circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the OR gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the OR operation. It takes two binary
      inputs and produces a single binary output, according to the truth table.
      The OR gate is essential in digital circuit design, as it is used in
      various applications, including logic function implementation, data
      routing, and arithmetic circuit design. Its simple yet powerful operation
      makes it a key component in modern digital electronics.
    </p>
    <h2>Not Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, is a fundamental building block
      of digital electronic circuits. It is a digital logic gate that performs
      the NOT operation, which is a basic operation in Boolean algebra. The NOT
      gate takes a single binary input (usually labeled A) and produces a single
      binary output (usually labeled Y), according to the following truth table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>Y</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is the complement of the input A. If A is
      0, then Y is 1, and if A is 1, then Y is 0. This behavior can be
      summarized by the Boolean expression Y = NOT A or Y = A', where '
      represents the NOT operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input A is connected to the left side of the gate, and the output Y is
      on the right side. The NOT gate is a unary gate, meaning it has only one
      input. One of the key properties of the NOT gate is its ability to invert
      the input signal. This property is useful in digital circuits for changing
      the logic level of a signal. For example, if the input signal is 0, the
      NOT gate will produce an output of 1, and if the input signal is 1, the
      NOT gate will produce an output of 0. This property is used in various
      digital circuits to complement signals and perform logical negation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NOT gate is used in combination with other logic gates to implement
      more complex logic functions. For example, by combining a NOT gate with an
      AND gate, one can implement a NAND gate, which is a universal gate that
      can be used to implement any Boolean function. Similarly, by combining a
      NOT gate with an OR gate, one can implement a NOR gate, another universal
      gate. The NOT gate is also used in flip-flops and other memory elements to
      store and manipulate binary information. In these applications, the NOT
      gate is used to invert the state of a signal, which can be used to change
      the state of the memory element.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the NOT gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the NOT operation. It takes a single
      binary input and produces a single binary output, which is the complement
      of the input. The NOT gate is essential in digital circuit design, as it
      is used to invert signals and implement logical negation. Its simple yet
      powerful operation makes it a key component in modern digital electronics.
    </p>
    <h2>Nand Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The NAND gate is a fundamental building block of digital electronic
      circuits. It is a digital logic gate that performs the NAND (NOT-AND)
      operation, which is a basic operation in Boolean algebra. The NAND gate
      takes two binary inputs (usually labeled A and B) and produces a single
      binary output (usually labeled Y), according to the following truth table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is 0 (or false) only when both inputs A
      and B are 1 (or true); otherwise, the output is 1 (or true). This behavior
      can be summarized by the Boolean expression Y = NOT (A AND B) or Y = A
      NAND B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inputs A and B are connected to the left side of the gate, and the
      output Y is on the right side. The NAND gate can have more than two
      inputs, in which case it behaves as if all inputs must be 1 for the output
      to be 0. One of the key properties of the NAND gate is its ability to
      function as a universal gate. This means that any other logical operation
      can be implemented using only NAND gates. For example, an OR gate can be
      implemented using NAND gates by connecting the inputs of the NAND gate to
      the inputs of the OR gate and connecting the output of the NAND gate to a
      NOT gate. Similarly, an AND gate can be implemented using NAND gates by
      connecting the inputs of the NAND gates to the inputs of the AND gate and
      connecting the outputs of the NAND gates to another NAND gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NAND gate is used in various digital circuits and systems for a wide
      range of applications. One common application is in the implementation of
      arithmetic circuits, where NAND gates are used to perform the bitwise NAND
      operation between binary numbers. In this application, each pair of
      corresponding bits in the two input numbers is fed into a NAND gate, and
      the outputs are then combined to produce the final result. Another common
      application of the NAND gate is in the implementation of logic functions
      and Boolean expressions. By combining multiple NAND gates with other logic
      gates such as OR gates and NOT gates, complex logic functions can be
      implemented. This allows digital designers to create circuits that perform
      a wide range of logical operations, making the NAND gate a versatile
      building block in digital circuit design.

      In summary, the NAND gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the NAND operation. It takes two binary
      inputs and produces a single binary output, according to the truth table.

      various applications, including logic function implementation, arithmetic
      circuit design, and universal gate implementation. Its simple yet powerful
      operation makes it a key component in modern digital electronics.

    <h2>Nor Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The NOR gate is a fundamental building block of digital electronic
      circuits. It is a digital logic gate that performs the NOR (NOT-OR)
      operation, which is a basic operation in Boolean algebra. The NOR gate
      takes two binary inputs (usually labeled A and B) and produces a single
      binary output (usually labeled Y), according to the following truth table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>

      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is 1 (or true) only when both inputs A
      and B are 0 (or false); otherwise, the output is 0 (or false). This
      behavior can be summarized by the Boolean expression Y = NOT (A OR B) or Y
      = A NOR B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inputs A and B are connected to the left side of the gate, and the
      output Y is on the right side. The NOR gate can have more than two inputs,
      in which case it behaves as if all inputs must be 0 for the output to be
      1. One of the key properties of the NOR gate is its ability to function as
      a universal gate, similar to the NAND gate. This means that any other
      logical operation can be implemented using only NOR gates. For example, an
      AND gate can be implemented using NOR gates by connecting the inputs of
      the NOR gate to the inputs of the AND gate and connecting the output of
      the NOR gate to a NOT gate. Similarly, an OR gate can be implemented using
      NOR gates by connecting the inputs of the NOR gates to the inputs of the
      OR gate and connecting the outputs of the NOR gates to another NOR gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NOR gate is used in various digital circuits and systems for a wide
      range of applications. One common application is in the implementation of
      logic functions and Boolean expressions. By combining multiple NOR gates
      with other logic gates such as AND gates and NOT gates, complex logic
      functions can be implemented. This allows digital designers to create
      circuits that perform a wide range of logical operations, making the NOR
      gate a versatile building block in digital circuit design. Another common
      application of the NOR gate is in the design of flip-flops and other
      memory elements. In these applications, the NOR gate is used to implement
      the feedback mechanism that allows the memory element to store and
      manipulate binary information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the NOR gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the NOR operation. It takes two binary
      inputs and produces a single binary output, according to the truth table.
      The NOR gate is essential in digital circuit design, as it is used in
      various applications, including logic function implementation, memory
      element design, and universal gate implementation. Its simple yet powerful
      operation makes it a key component in modern digital electronics.

    <h2>Xor Gate</h2>
    <p>
      The XOR gate, short for exclusive OR gate, is a digital logic gate that
      performs the exclusive OR operation. It takes two binary inputs (usually
      labeled A and B) and produces a single binary output (usually labeled Y),
      according to the following truth table:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In the truth table, the output Y is 1 (or true) if either input A or input
      B is 1, but not both. If both inputs are 0 or both inputs are 1, the
      output is 0 (or false). This behavior can be summarized by the Boolean
      expression Y = A XOR B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inputs A and B are connected to the left side of the gate, and the
      output Y is on the right side. The XOR gate can also be represented by the
      following Boolean expression: Y = (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B) One of
      the key properties of the XOR gate is its ability to detect when the
      number of 1s in its inputs is odd. This property makes the XOR gate useful
      in error detection and correction circuits, as well as in cryptographic
      algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XOR gate is used in various digital circuits and systems for a wide
      range of applications. One common application is in the implementation of
      arithmetic circuits, where XOR gates are used to perform the bitwise XOR
      operation between binary numbers. In this application, each pair of
      corresponding bits in the two input numbers is fed into an XOR gate, and
      the outputs are then combined to produce the final result. Another common
      application of the XOR gate is in the implementation of parity check
      circuits. In these circuits, XOR gates are used to calculate the parity of
      a set of binary inputs. If the number of 1s in the inputs is odd, the
      output of the XOR gate is 1, indicating an error. The XOR gate is also
      used in the design of flip-flops and other memory elements. In these
      applications, the XOR gate is used to implement the feedback mechanism
      that allows the memory element to store and manipulate binary information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, the XOR gate is a fundamental building block of digital
      electronic circuits that performs the exclusive OR operation. It takes two
      binary inputs and produces a single binary output, according to the truth
      table. The XOR gate is essential in digital circuit design, as it is used
      in various applications, including arithmetic circuit design, error
      detection and correction, and memory element design. Its unique behavior
      makes it a valuable component in modern digital electronics.
