    <h1>Latches</h1>
    <p>
      In digital logic, a latch is a circuit that can store one bit of
      information. Latches are similar to flip-flops but are level sensitive,
      meaning they can change their output whenever the input changes and the
      clock signal meets certain conditions, rather than only changing on a
      clock edge like a flip-flop. Latches are often used in digital systems for
      temporary storage or as building blocks for more complex circuits. There
      are several types of latches, with the most common being the SR latch, the
      D latch, and the JK latch.
    </p>
    <h2>SR Latch</h2>
    <p>
      The SR latch has two inputs, S (set) and R (reset), and two outputs, Q and
      Q'. When S is high and R is low, the Q output is set to high and the Q'
      output is set to low. When R is high and S is low, the Q output is set to
      low and the Q' output is set to high. When both S and R are low, the latch
      holds its previous state. The SR latch is level-sensitive, meaning its
      outputs can change as long as the inputs are held at the appropriate
      levels.
    </p>
    <h2>D Latch</h2>
    <p>
      The D latch has a single data input (D), a clock input (CLK), and two
      outputs, Q and Q'. When the clock signal transitions to a specific level
      (either high or low, depending on the latch type), the value of D is
      transferred to the output Q. The D latch is level-sensitive and can change
      its output whenever the input changes, as long as the clock signal meets
      the latch's timing requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>JK Latch</h2>
    <p>
      The JK latch is similar to the SR latch but includes an additional input,
      K (kill). The JK latch has two stable states, like the SR latch, but the
      inputs have different meanings. When J=K=1, the latch toggles its state,
      meaning if Q=1, it becomes 0, and if Q=0, it becomes 1. This behavior is
      similar to a T flip-flop. The JK latch is level-sensitive and can change
      its output whenever the input changes and the clock signal meets the
      latch's timing requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latches are used in digital logic simulators to store intermediate values,
      create temporary storage elements, and implement certain types of
      circuits. They are especially useful in asynchronous circuits, where
      timing constraints are less rigid than in synchronous circuits that use
      flip-flops. Latches can be used to hold data temporarily before it is
      transferred to a flip-flop or to create feedback loops in digital systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summary, latches are level-sensitive storage elements used in digital
      logic to temporarily store one bit of information. They are similar to
      flip-flops but are more flexible in terms of when they can change their
      output. Latches are commonly used in digital systems for temporary
      storage, feedback loops, and other applications where asynchronous
      behavior is desired.

    <h4>Q 1 - How does a latch differ from a flip-flop?</h4>
    <input type="radio" name="a" /> Latches are edge-triggered, while flip-flops
    are level-sensitive.
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="a" /> Latches can only store one bit of
    information, while flip-flops can store multiple bits.
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="a" /> Latches change their output whenever the
    input changes and the clock signal meets certain conditions, while
    flip-flops only change on a clock edge.
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="a" /> Latches are only used for temporary storage,
    while flip-flops are used for long-term storage.

      reset (R) inputs are low?
    </h4>
    <input type="radio" name="b" /> The output is set to high
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="b" /> The output is reset to low
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="b" /> The output holds its previous state
    <br />
    <input type="radio" name="b" /> The output toggles between high and low
    <h4>Q 3 - How does a D latch differ from an SR latch?</h4>
